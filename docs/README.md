In this project, subsets by `data_channel_is_*` were produced for automating Markdown reports. Variables were selected from each subset by the best subset and stepwise selction methods. Predictive models including the linear regression models, lasso models, random forest models and boosted tree models were constructed using 5-fold cross-validation. These models were first constructed on training data set and than tested on test data set. The best model were selected based on lowest RMSE.

params = lapply(channels, FUN = function(x){list(channel = x)})

reports <- tibble(output.file, params)

library(rmarkdown)

apply(reports, MARGIN = 1,
